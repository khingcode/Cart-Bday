            <p>Happiest Birthday to my NUMBER ONE DGROUP LEADER!!!
                This isn't much but I hope you will enjoy this simple website I coded for you!!!
                Honestly, I'm just extremely blessed to have a DGROUP Leader 
                like you. Someone who is intentional in tending his flock, and a
                reliable and dependable person that people go to for sound opinion and for
                spiritual advice. One of the characteristics I admire from you is how well you adapt
                in social scenarios as well as making people feel like they belong. You might think it's 
                not a big deal or it comes naturally for you, but not everyone can do that, at the same time
                not everyone has the same heart as you, so its a reminder from me that it's one of your assets,
                always use it to advance the kingdom of God. I appreciate that you're always ready to hear out 
                my thoughts, no matter how random and braindead they may be, at the same time, I appreciate that you
                trust me enough in my waiting season. There were a lot of times where I would share about zoe and i'd 
                be surprised of your response like "WOAH?! U TRUST ME THIS MUCH?" and I appreciate it, and I appreciate
                YOU! I guess one of your drawbacks is your social battery dies out fast HAHHAHA, you'd be unstoppable
                if you had no limit (REAL). Continue to be a blessing to other people! You may not immediatley see or feel
                it but know that other people appreciate it when you help them even if they don't state it initially.
                LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MY DGROUP LEADER!!! TO MORE ADVENTURES WITH YOU, IN BODY AND IN SPIRIT! GOD BLESS ALWAYS!
